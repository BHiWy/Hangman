A C++ Hangman Game with a GUI can be a fun and interactive way to play the classic word-guessing game. 

Game Overview:
The Hangman game involves a player trying to guess a word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. For each incorrect guess, 
a part of a stick figure is drawn and if the player fails to guess the word before the stick figure is complete, they lose.
